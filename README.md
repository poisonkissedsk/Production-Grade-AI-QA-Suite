# Production-Grade AI QA Suite

This repository contains a **Production-Grade AI Quality Assurance (QA) Suite** designed for enterprise-level machine learning systems. It provides structured, automated, and explainable testing of AI pipelines, ensuring fairness, reliability, robustness, and explainability in critical decision-making models.

---

## üìä Overview

This suite simulates an AI-based hiring platform using the **UCI Adult Income Dataset**, evaluating the pipeline across key production criteria:

- **Bias and Fairness Auditing**
- **Explainability Testing (SHAP-based)**
- **Robustness & Adversarial Testing**
- **End-to-End Pipeline Health Monitoring**
- **Drift Detection & Continuous Monitoring**
- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration for Automated QA**
