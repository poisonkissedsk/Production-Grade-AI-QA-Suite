# Production-Grade AI QA Suite

This repository contains a **Production-Grade AI Quality Assurance (QA) Suite** designed for enterprise-level machine learning systems. It provides structured, automated, and explainable testing of AI pipelines, ensuring fairness, reliability, robustness, and explainability in critical decision-making models.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Simulating a real-world **AI-based hiring platform**, this suite evaluates whether the automated screening model:
- Treats all demographic groups fairly,
- Provides clear, explainable decisions,
- Remains robust under input noise,
- Continuously monitors its stability after deployment,
- And passes strict QA checks automatically before release.

## üìÇ Dataset: UCI Adult Income Dataset

- **Task:** Binary classification ‚Äì predict whether a person earns >$50K/year.
- **Used as:** Proxy for resume screening in hiring systems.

| Feature Type           | Features |
|------------------------|----------|
| Demographic (Categorical) | workclass, education, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, native-country |
| Numerical Features        | age, fnlwgt, education-num, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week |
| Label (Target)            | income (transformed to 1 if >$50K, else 0) |

Chosen for its inclusion of **protected attributes** (race, sex), enabling real-world bias and fairness evaluations.
